    <p>Hey I'm Rakib Ahmed, but you can call me Ricky! I launched my first professional website in 2016. I Designed & Developed it for a prominent client in the entertainment industry. I was 19 years old… A lot has changed since then… Now, with amplified aesthetics from getting extremely familiar with all graphic design, web and coding Adobe Creative Cloud Apps,  I learned how to design & develop cleaner sites in platforms such as WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Shopify and even hard-coding sites from scratch.</p>
